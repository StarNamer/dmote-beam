# DMOTE Beam

3D models for an accessory to the
[DMOTE keyboard](http://viktor.eikman.se/article/the-dmote/): Plastic parts
holding a simple “beam”, typically just a hollow metal rod about half an inch
wide. This beam, sold separately by your local
hardware store, stabilizes the split keyboard and carries the wire that
connects its two halves electronically.

This is just an example. Feel free to accessorize however you like.

## Usage

Use `lein run` with command-line arguments to generate files of OpenSCAD code
under `output/scad` and, optionally, STL files for slicing and 3D printing.
